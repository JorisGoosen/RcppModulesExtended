Title: Extends Rcpp-Modules with named-arguments
Version: 1.0
Date: 2018-04-03
Author: Joris Goosen
Maintainer: Joris Goosen <joris@jorisgoosen.nl>
Description: Because updating Rcpp with an extension to Rcpp-Modules changes its ABI some changes have been moved to a seperate package.
        This is to allow named-arguments that are more akin to standard R functioncalls to be used by modules-using-cpp-classes.
